    <string name="tutorial_dialog_title">SMS -> Telegram forwarder</string>
    <string name="tutorial_dialog_description">
This application is intended to forward incoming SMS messages to a Telegram bot.
\n\nIt may be useful to receive SMS messages from a rarely used sim-card which you don\'t want to keep with you all the time.
\n\nYou can install it on an unused device at home, connected to the internet.
\n\nTo setup correctly you need to set Telegram User ID (may be acquired via a special bot) and your Bot ID (you need to create it via @BotFather)
and copy Bot\'s secret key to a corresponding field.
\n\nYou should also send any message first to a bot from your Telegram account because bots can not send messages to users first.
\n\nTo verify everything is set up correctly check that both \"Test\" buttons are sending something to your Telegram account via Bot.
\n\nThis app\'s source code is published under open-source license, so you can verify it does not do anything else than described above.

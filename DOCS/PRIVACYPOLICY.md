Privacy Policy for SMS2TG

Effective Date: 10.05.2025

SMS2TG (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.
This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users (“you”) about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our mobile application.


1. Information Collection and Use
The App does not automatically collect or store any personal data on our servers. All user configurations and data are stored locally on the user's device.

However, the App is capable of sending SMS messages content to a Telegram bot that is explicitly specified by the user. This means:

The App only sends SMS messages when the user explicitly enables forwarding functionality.

The destination (Telegram bot token and chat ID) is provided and configured by the user.

No data is sent anywhere without the user's intent and explicit setup.

2. Permissions Used
The App requests the following Android permissions:

READ\_PHONE\_STATE: Used solely to detect phone call status (e.g., to pause operations during calls). This information is not stored or transmitted.

RECEIVE\_SMS and/or READ\_SMS: Used to detect incoming SMS messages for forwarding, only when configured.

INTERNET: Used to connect to the Telegram Bot API and forward messages as directed by the user.

3. Data Transmission
All data sent from the App is:

Triggered by user actions or configurations.

Sent directly to the Telegram bot endpoint the user has provided.

Not transmitted to or stored on any server controlled by the app developer.

The app developer does not have access to any messages, contact data, or bot credentials unless explicitly shared by the user.

4. Open Source
This App is fully open-source. Users are encouraged to review the source code to verify the App’s behavior and data handling practices.

Source Code Repository: https://github.com/AlexTaran/sms2tg

5. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose any user data to third parties. The App does not use analytics, advertising, or third-party SDKs.

6. Security
Since the App does not collect or retain data, there is minimal risk of data exposure from the app itself. However, users should secure their Telegram bot tokens and use caution when choosing where to forward SMS messages.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and/or on the associated project page.
